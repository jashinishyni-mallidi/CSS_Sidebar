# CSS_Sidebar

I developed a responsive Sidebar Menu without using JavaScript. This project leverages modern CSS techniques to create an interactive and user-friendly design. Key features and techniques include:

Checkbox with Dual Labels: Implemented a checkbox with two labels to control the sidebar's visibility, ensuring seamless interaction.
Positioning: Utilized advanced positioning strategies to initially place the sidebar -300px from the left.
Transition and Transform: Employed CSS transitions and transforms to create a smooth hover effect that brings the sidebar into view when the icon is clicked.
This approach ensures a responsive and visually appealing sidebar that enhances the overall user experience.
